What is machine learning?
* training your computer to recognize patterns in data in order to make predictions.

What is training?
* Give the compute examples of how it should map an observations' known features to a known target.

What do we need to give a trained model to get an prediction?
* You feed the trained model the features it was was trained on and it will make a prediction.

How do you tell if your model is good?
* You give it testing data which is different observations with the same features and target. You send each of the observations features to get a prediction for each observations. Then you compare the predictions with the known values of the target.

Types of Machine Learning?
* supervised (input or features to an output or target)
	- regression (continuous target)
	- classification (discrete target)
* unsupervised (no targets)
	- clustering
	- dimensional reduction

Applications of Machine Learning?
* recommender system
* computer vision or image recognition
* Speech recognition
* Natural language processing (NLP)
