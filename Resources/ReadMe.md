# What is **Resources**? 

**Resources** is a dedicated folder for you to find links to relevant topics. It should help trouble shoot and answer many basic questions & clarification you come across. Use this to help you help yourself. 

The folders & ReadMe, along with their descriptions, within **Resources** are: 
1. **Cheet Sheets** -> PDF's to use a a referece for most commonly used commands, functions/methods, and syntax.
2. **Documentation** -> Offical (or semi-official) documenation .
    -  "documentation" is a term used to describe all the nitty-gritty of a language/tool/etc, usually written by the developers of the language and/or tool. (Safe to just user a finder (CMD+F) to search for keywords and/or specific methods of relevance.
3. **ReadMe** contains MANY links to web-based cheatsheets/documentation/videos. All of this is GOOGLE-ABLE, but here's some to get you started. A lot of the links in each topic/subtopic are redundent, but presented slightly differently. Find what works for you and **BOOKMARK** them so you can use them in the future.
    - Make sure to check out the **Try it out** section at the BOTTOM!
